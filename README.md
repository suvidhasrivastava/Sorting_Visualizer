# Sorting_Visualizer

## The General Sorting Visualizer is a Python project that allows users to visualize the process of various sorting algorithms using Matplotlib. Key features include:

### User Input: Users can input their own unsorted array of numbers, along with a customizable delay between visualization steps.

## Algorithm Options: The program supports multiple sorting algorithms, including:

Bubble Sort
Selection Sort
Insertion Sort
Quick Sort
Merge Sort

## Visualization Choices: Users can select from different visualization styles to represent the sorting process:

Bar Chart
Line Graph
Scatter Plot
Matrix Visualization
3D Visualization

### Interactive Visualization: The sorting process is visualized in real-time, allowing users to observe the mechanics of each algorithm as it sorts the array.

### Final Output: After sorting, the program displays the sorted array and visualizes it again using the chosen method.

### This project enhances understanding of sorting algorithms by combining user interactivity with dynamic visual representation, making it an effective educational tool.
